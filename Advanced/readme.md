# Requirements

Before running Producer or Consumer code, make sure:

* installed kafka broker

* downloaded twcs.csv from [link_to_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter/) to directory src/main/java

* Also, that the cluster is raised to initialize the code. You can start the cluster using run-cluster.sh and disable it accordingly using shutdown-cluster.sh
